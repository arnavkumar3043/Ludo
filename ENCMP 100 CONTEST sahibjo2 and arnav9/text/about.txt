
Ludo is a classic board game that involves moving pieces around a square board to reach a designated finishing point. Players take turns rolling a die or dice to determine how many spaces their pieces can move. The goal is to be the first to move all of one's pieces from the starting point to the finishing point.

Originating in India as the game Pachisi, Ludo has evolved over centuries and spread worldwide. It gained popularity during the British Rule and was eventually standardized into the modern Ludo game we know today. The game's simplicity and element of luck make it enjoyable for players of all ages.
